__Real-time dynamic path planning based on stereovision input__
<br>
This repository was created in order to prototype processing of data from stereovision camera ZED2 without need of using GPU of nvidia jetson.
 This program is able to create three dimensional points cloud of data based on calculated distortion from cameras and then calculate optimal
 trajectory for mobile robot.
<br>
This approche is currently refactoring to C++(or not), as it proves itslef to be effective.
